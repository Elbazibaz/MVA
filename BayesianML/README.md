On the Impact of the Activation Function on Deep Neural Networks Training - Soufiane Hayou /Arnaud Doucet /Judith Rousseau
MVA - Project 2020

## Content :
> The first jupyter notebook called **BayesianNN.ipynb** implements some of the results present in the paper.
> * Impact of the EOC initialization
> * Impact of the initialization of bias distribution's variance on deep networks performance
>
> The second jupyter notebook **BNN_Further_EXP.ipynb** runs a bayesian neural network on MNIST dataset. It was part of our process to get familiar with the associated libraries. However it does not relate directly with our project.

## Requirements :
> The following packages are needed : 
> * <code>torch</code>
> * <code>pyro4</code>
