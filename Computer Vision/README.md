>**Description**: In this project, we will study some of the recent state-of-the-art approaches for image captioning [3, 4, 5]. The idea is to learn and explore two main aspects of the models. Firstly, what does attention mean in the context of image captioning? How is focusing on certain image regions achieved -- top-down or bottom-up methods [4], and how can attention be used to make the results more interpretable. The second part of the project could explore how is Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradients [5] used to further improve captioning. In particular, how can one incorporate a non-differentiable metric (e.g., BLEU, CIDER, METEOR) into the learning approach to fine-tune the model and obtain further improvements.
